1. let's say you want to make a folder public and inside it you want to make another folder say temp.
which you will use in future and u want to push it on git .
as both folders are empty git will not push it so a way to do this is to make a ".gitkeep" file in temp
.gitkeep won't have anything i.e. that will be empty only but now you can push it on github

2. .gitignore - it will contain files that we don't want to push on github say sensitive information etc.
there is a gitingore generator in which if you will type node it will give you general files 
that is not meant for pushing it on github and extras you can add too.

3. environment variables system se uthaye jaate hai jisse ye secure rahe , ye files se nahi uthaye jaate

4. dev dependcies jo build level par contribute na kare file bulk mein
5."scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon src/index.js"  
  },
--> now npm run dev will say do nodemon src/index.js that is it will run index.js (hamne padha tha na how to run a program from node/nodemon)
this made it easy and nothing else 

6. the format and file str is what and how a professional project should be approached.
